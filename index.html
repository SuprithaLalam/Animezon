<div> Demon Slayer season 3 has already been confirmed, so you can rest easy that it's not the end of the story yet.
The hugely popular anime series, whose first spin-off movie Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba â€“ The Movie: Mugen Train was the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, has amassed a legion of global fans who are now eagerly awaiting news of the show's return.
The second season, containing the Mugen Train and Entertainment District arcs, has officially ended, so now the wait begins for more adventures starring Tanjiro and Nezuko.
Here's everything you need to know about Demon Slayer season 3.</div><br>

<h2> Demon Slayer season 3 potential release date: When will Demon Slayer season 3 air?</h2><br><br>
<div> First, the bad news. There was a two-and-a-bit year gap between the first and second seasons of Demon Slayer, and we'd expect the same for its third outing.
So while there is currently no announced release date yet for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Swordsmith Village arc, we'd guess the third season will release around fall 2023.
There was some good news in February 2022 though, when the official Demon Slayer account tweeted the first teaser image for the third season and confirmed it was officially in production.</div>
